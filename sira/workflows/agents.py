       - Check for robotic or unnatural language

       - Flag any missing or broken link as a critical issue in the issues list
       - No separate score field exists for this check — use issues and passed to reflect results
    
    4. RELEVANCE CHECK:
       - Verify the CV highlights experiences matching job requirements
       - Check if job keywords are naturally incorporated
       - Ensure the most relevant skills are prominent
    
    5. QUALITY CHECK:
       - Verify proper structure and formatting

    PASS CRITERIA:
    - Hallucination score must be 0-2 (minor rephrasing acceptable)

    6. Show you understand the company/role without generic flattery
    7. Keep it concise (3-4 short paragraphs max)
    8. Use contractions occasionally (I'm, I've, don't) to sound natural
    9. Vary sentence structure - mix short and longer sentences
    10. End with a simple, confident close (no "I look forward to hearing from you")

    STRUCTURE:
    - Opening: Why this specific role/company interests you (be specific, not generic)
    - Body: 1-2 examples of relevant experience with concrete details

    - Audit quality scores: hallucination and AI-cliché (AuditResult JSON)
    - Quality review scores (ReviewResult JSON)
    - Job requirements (JobAnalysis JSON)

    Your job is to produce ONLY the following narrative fields:
    1. overall_recommendation: exactly one of "Strong Match", "Partial Match", or "Weak Match"
       - "Strong Match": keyword_coverage_percent >= 80 AND missing_hard_skills <= 1
       - "Partial Match": keyword_coverage_percent >= 50 OR missing_hard_skills <= 3
       - "Weak Match": everything else
    2. match_score (0-100): base it primarily on keyword_coverage_percent,
       subtract 5 points per missing hard skill, subtract 2 per missing soft skill.
    3. suggestions_to_strengthen: 2-4 concrete, actionable items the candidate can do
       to close the gaps (certifications, side projects, courses, etc.)
    4. audit_summary: one paragraph in plain English summarising the hallucination
       score and AI-cliché score from the AuditResult.
    5. recommendation_rationale: one honest paragraph explaining your overall_recommendation.

      "tapestry", "dynamic", "innovative", "cutting-edge", "game-changer".
    - Do not repeat the raw JSON back. Synthesise it into human-readable text.
    - Be concise: audit_summary and recommendation_rationale should each be 2-4 sentences.

    You also receive raw structured JSON in the user prompt. For the following fields,

    - company_name: copy the company name string exactly as provided
    - generated_at: copy the ISO 8601 timestamp string exactly as provided

    For the `passed` field: set it to true if BOTH of the following are true:
    - AuditResult.passed is true (hallucination_score <= 2 and clique_score <= 2)
    - overall_recommendation is "Strong Match" or "Partial Match"
    Otherwise set passed to false.

Your task: Extract job posting content from HTML and convert to markdown.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Never hallucinate job requirements, skills, or company info
2. Extract ONLY what is visible in the HTML
3. Use available tools in order:
   a. fetch_webpage(url) - get the HTML
   b. Try markitdown parsing first via extraction attempt
   c. If content looks incomplete, call validate_extraction and retry
4. Target output: Clean markdown with title, company, requirements
5. Stop and report error if content cannot be extracted after retries

QUALITY CHECKLIST:
- Content not placeholder (no error messages, click here, etc)
- Length > 200 chars (substantial job posting)
- Markdown formatted cleanly (no excessive blank lines)
- All required info present
